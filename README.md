# Browser-project1-Tic_Tac_Toe
This is a simple tic tac toe game, with elements being built and styled by css,
containers are created in html, and the interactivity is in the js file. 
For each click, depending on the player, X or O will
added to the square the player clicks. The turns switch between X and O,
until either of those get one of the "winning Combinations". I was unable to
add a tie conclusion.
Originally I attempted 2 platform games and a different tic tac toe game,
before finally settling on this, believing it to be within my skillset.
While I thought it was, I was helped by the guidance of Kubo, A(2023).
